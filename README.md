# AutoCAD and BricsCAD Scripts
This repository contains a variety of LISP routines that can be used to streamline tasks in AutoCAD and BricsCAD. Whether youâ€™re looking to automate repetitive tasks or add new functionality to your CAD software, these scripts can help improve your productivity.

In the command line enter "script" command and browse to the downloaded script file then run it. It will run only on the active drawing.

See my Batch Scripter application to run one or more scripts on multiple drawings.
